         * - Collector has these items counts in the slots 1, 2, 0; slot 0 is partially filled, slot 1 is full, slot 2 is producing
         * - Why is slot 0 partially filled? 
         *   a) Maybe the player previously removed only 1 out of 2 already produced items out of it.
         *   b) Maybe this mod removed 1 item from it for crafting
         *   --> Either way, that slot is not filled completely, but it is also not producing anything
     *****   --> Case a) is already how the game behaves unmodded, so for now not changing that behaviour
         * - In the future, we might want to change this behaviour to always remove full stacks from the collector
         * - "Compressing" the slots, where we change the slots counts to be 2,1,0 would not mean slot 1 is producing
         * - Alternatively, making slot 0 start producing at 50% would mean destroying the already produced water in it
         * - We can consolidate all the produced items into the available slots, up to max stack size of the item, but that
         *   seems like too much work with not much gain, and probably not very predictable.
         *   Also this would change the behaviour a lot, meaning collectors could produce many more items than
         *   usual, which might not be what players expect, and might be too powerful.
